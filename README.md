# Place/Pixel Thing

Based on https://github.com/xSke/Pxls

Just messing around in node.js

Installation instructions:
## 1 - Clone it
```git clone https://github.com/liamcottam/place```
## 2 - Install node.js libs
```npm install```
## 3 - Run it
```node app.js```

By default it will run on port 3000, but this can be changed in the file ```config.js```.
